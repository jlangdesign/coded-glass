# Coded Glass
_Coded Glass_ explores the urgency of the #metoo movement, the role of social technology, and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web as a form of community building and reflection through stained glass imagery, a rich art historical material. Using collected data and analysis of 2,629,581 #metoo tweets from October 1, 2017 to August 15, 2018 as source material, this visual exhibit by artist and activist [Liss LaFleur](https://www.lisslafleur.com/) showcases stained glass windows of protest signs, emojis, and hashtags from the #metoo movement as a form of data visualization and metaphor for creating communal sacred spaces.

## About
_Coded Glass_ is a web-based visual application built at NCSU Libraries as part of the [Immersive Scholar project](https://www.immersivescholar.org/) and is responsively designed for exhibit across a diverse range of large-scale displays. _Coded Glass_ is primarily featured in the [iPearl Immersion Theater](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/visualization_templates/blob/master/HuntLibraryVideoWallGuide.md#ipearl-immersion-theater) at the James B. Hunt Jr. Library at NC State University.

This application was built using Webpack 3 and is optimized to run in the Chrome browser.

_Coded Glass_ is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be run via the following link: https://jlangdesign.github.io/coded-glass/.

## Notes
This exhibit is designed for both non-interactive large-scale displays and interactive personal devices (i.e. desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones) but not optimized for all sizes and aspect ratios yet.

Here, a "large-scale display" is defined as a screen with a viewport height greater than or equal to 2100px (vh â‰¥ 2100px). Anything below 2100px high is considered a "personal device" screen size.
